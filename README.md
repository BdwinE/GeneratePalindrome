# GeneratePalindrome
## Description ##
Given an intereger number n, the program generates all sequence of numbers that are palindromes that sum up to that number n.
Example: n=5, Generated Palindromes: 1 3 1, 1 1 1 1 1, 2 1 2, 5
As n increases the time needed to generate all palidromes increases exponitenally. This prgoram was written with the expectation that it should generated
all palindromes for 40 in under 30 minutes, it's able to do it in 6.
